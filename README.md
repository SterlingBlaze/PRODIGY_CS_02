# Image Encryption and Decryption Tool

This Python script allows you to encrypt and decrypt images using a simple mathematical operation on pixel values.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Encrypt any image by applying a mathematical operation (addition) to each pixel.
- **Decryption:** Decrypt encrypted images using the same mathematical operation (subtraction) applied to each pixel.
- **Customization:** Easily adjust the encryption key to control the level of security.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (Python Imaging Library fork)

You can install Pillow using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow
